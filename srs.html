<h3 id="Purpose">1.1	Purpose</h3>
<p>The name of the software which software requirements are specified in this document is <strong>"IntProf"</strong>, which will act as a dynamic Online Teaching Assistant (Online TA) system. Current release number is 1.0.0.</p>

<h3 id="Intended_Audience">1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
<p>The document is mainly intended for 3 kinds of people. They are:
<ul>
	<li>Project Executives (who are going to construct the whole system in many stages, i.e. Developers, project manager, testers, marketing staffs and documentation writer)</li>
	<li>Users (Teachers, Students)</li>
	<li>System Administrators (who are going to administrate the system after when it runs)</li>
</ul>
For all of the readers the Introduction section is very important. Because everyone is going to get a glimpse of what this project is intended for, what is the usability of this and system and what is the main characteristics of this system. For the Developers and other Project Executives <strong>Section 2, 3, 4, 5</strong> are very important as the main project scopes, detailed requirements and other related specifications are sketched there. For the marketing staffs <strong>Section 1, 5</strong> are the most important part for gathering marketing hints.
<strong>Section 4: System Features</strong> is important for all the audience as this part describes in details what the features of the system are but if anyone is only intending for knowing the product features in brief then <strong>Section 1.4</strong> will be very helpful. 

</p>
<h3 id="Product_Scope">1.4	Product Scope</h3>
<p>This website is going to be worked as a complete system where teacher and students will be connected virtually. Teachers can create classes and students can enroll themselves after a process of verification. There will be scope for live classes through video sharing. It will also work as a Q&A platform among students and teachers. Teachers can post assignments and students can also submit their works online. This platform will be also used for posting grades and/or marks. A student can check out his/her live standing/performance in different classes. We are hoping to launch online attendance system in every classes.</p>

</ul>
<h3>2.3	User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
<p>There will be 2types of users Admin and general users</p>
<h3>Admin</h3>
<p>It can pretty much do everything. Admin can login to his/ her account; they can add data, delete data or edit data based on the requirement. The admins can manage/modify information. They can see the user details, student feedback. Admins can logout from his account. </p>
<h3>User </h3>
<p>General users can use both the website and mobile app. They will have an account. Users can search, view, ask/reply questions in Q/A bar, take attendance and Take/attend online classes. They can?t change anything of the system. After login they will search according to their need, and the system will provide information.</p>
<p>The system is mainly for the Teachers and students. Teachers and students can use this website for information about the courses, assignments, attendance, marks that they are searching for. They can get all the information in details information. It can be helpful for other users too; those who wants to know the course .But the most important users are the teachers and students.</p>
<h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Operating environment is as listed below.</li>
	<li>Distributed database</li>
	<li>Client/server system </li>
	<li>Operating system: Windows, however, it will be a website, so will be able to run on any operating system</li>
	<li>Database: MYSQL database </li>
	<li>Platform: JavaScript, PHP</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.5	  Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
<p>User should have internet connection. Without an internet connection, the users cannot log in to the system. So, they cannot interact with the system without internet.</p>
<p>Another constraint is data capacity. As we are not using our own data center, we are might face issue with capacity.</p>

<h3>2.6	  User Documentation</h3>
<p>The system will provide a user manual along with the software and there will be a disk which contains video tutorial.</p>
<h3>2.7	  Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
<p>User interface and some functionalities can change during the development process of project. And also new functionalities can be added which is able to change the dependent system requirements.</p>
<p>If the phone does not have enough hardware resources available for the application, for example, the users might have allocated them with other applications; there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended or even at all.</p>

<h2>3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
<h3>3.1 User Interfaces </h3>
<p>The website will have a straightforward and a clean look which easy to navigate. At first sight, a user will feel everything in the website is well organized and easy to explore. There will be two separate User Interfaces. One for the teacher while other for the student.</p>
