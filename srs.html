<p>The system is mainly for the Teachers and students. Teachers and students can use this website for information about the courses, assignments, attendance, marks that they are searching for. They can get all the information in details information. It can be helpful for other users too; those who wants to know the course .But the most important users are the teachers and students.</p>
<h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Operating environment is as listed below.</li>
	<li>Distributed database</li>

	<li>Database: MYSQL database </li>
	<li>Platform: JavaScript, PHP</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.5	  Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
<p>User should have internet connection. Without an internet connection, the users cannot log in to the system. So, they cannot interact with the system without internet.</p>
<p>Another constraint is data capacity. As we are not using our own data center, we are might face issue with capacity.</p>

<h3>2.6	  User Documentation</h3>
<p>The system will provide a user manual along with the software and there will be a disk which contains video tutorial.</p>
<h3>2.7	  Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
<p>User interface and some functionalities can change during the development process of project. And also new functionalities can be added which is able to change the dependent system requirements.</p>
<p>If the phone does not have enough hardware resources available for the application, for example, the users might have allocated them with other applications; there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended or even at all.</p>
