<h2 id="Introduction">1.Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="Purpose">1.1	Purpose</h3>
<p>The name of the software which software requirements are specified in this document is <strong>"IntProf"</strong>, which will act as a dynamic Online Teaching Assistant (Online TA) system. Current release number is 1.0.0.</p>
<h3 id="Document_Conventions">1.2	Document Conventions</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Font family: Times New Roman</li>
	<li>Font Size: 11</li>

</p>	
<h3 id="Intended_Audience">1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
<p>The document is mainly intended for 3 kinds of people. They are:
<ul>
	<li>Project Executives (who are going to construct the whole system in many stages, i.e. Developers, project manager, testers, marketing staffs and documentation writer)</li>
	<li>Users (Teachers, Students)</li>
	<li>System Administrators (who are going to administrate the system after when it runs)</li>
</ul>
For all of the readers the Introduction section is very important. Because everyone is going to get a glimpse of what this project is intended for, what is the usability of this and system and what is the main characteristics of this system. For the Developers and other Project Executives <strong>Section 2, 3, 4, 5</strong> are very important as the main project scopes, detailed requirements and other related specifications are sketched there. For the marketing staffs <strong>Section 1, 5</strong> are the most important part for gathering marketing hints.
<strong>Section 4: System Features</strong> is important for all the audience as this part describes in details what the features of the system are but if anyone is only intending for knowing the product features in brief then <strong>Section 1.4</strong> will be very helpful. 

</p>
<h3 id="Product_Scope">1.4	Product Scope</h3>
<p>This website is going to be worked as a complete system where teacher and students will be connected virtually. Teachers can create classes and students can enroll themselves after a process of verification. There will be scope for live classes through video sharing. It will also work as a Q&A platform among students and teachers. Teachers can post assignments and students can also submit their works online. This platform will be also used for posting grades and/or marks. A student can check out his/her live standing/performance in different classes. We are hoping to launch online attendance system in every classes.</p>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id= "Design and Implementation Constraints">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
<p>User should have internet connection. Without an internet connection, the users cannot log in to the system. So, they cannot interact with the system without internet.</p>
<p>Another constraint is data capacity. As we are not using our own data center, we are might face issue with capacity.</p>

<h3 id= "User Documentation">2.6 User Documentation</h3>
<p>The system will provide a user manual along with the software and there will be a disk which contains video tutorial.</p>
<h3 id= "Assumptions and Dependencies">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
<p>User interface and some functionalities can change during the development process of project. And also new functionalities can be added which is able to change the dependent system requirements.</p>
<p>If the phone does not have enough hardware resources available for the application, for example, the users might have allocated them with other applications; there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended or even at all.</p>
</body>


<h2 id= "External Interface Requirements">3.External Interface Requirements</h2>
<h3 id= "User Interfaces">3.1 User Interfaces </h3>
<p>The website will have a straightforward and a clean look which easy to navigate. At first sight, a user will feel everything in the website is well organized and easy to explore. There will be two separate User Interfaces. One for the teacher while other for the student.</p>
<p>There will be graphical user interface (GUI) which will allow the users to provide feedback. The teachers can post grades here on real time and system will make a statistical standing and keep it updated. Errors will be displayed if user give wrong inputs.  There will also be a help button which when the user presses will show information to the user about the page content and this button will appear on every page. </p>
<p>Front end Software: HTML, CSS and WordPress</p>
<p>Back end Software: PHP, Laravel Framework, JavaScript, JQuery & MySQL</p>
<h3 id = "Hardware Interfaces">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
<p>Any Device that is able to run a web browser which has the ability to process above mentioned Front end software and also the device has to meet the requirements of the browser to run without lagging. </p>
<h3 id= "Software Interfaces">3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
<p>Mentioned below are the software required for the website:</p>
<table style="width:100%; text-align: left;">
  <tr>
    <th>Software used</th>
    <th>Version</th> 
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Operating System</td>
    <td>   Any</td> 
    <td>This is a website, a browser based system, so any OS that can run a browser will be able to run it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Database</td>
    <td>My SQL</td> 
    <td>To save records including classes, student?s results, attendance, etc. </td>
  </tr>

<h2 id="Other Nonfunctional Requirements">5.Other Non-functional Requirements</h2>
<p>Here, we specify some non-functional constraints that the website satisfies in order to be more concrete and stable.</p>
<h3 id="Performance Requirement">5.1 Performance Requirements</h3>
<p>Registration: 
The website will require teachers and students to register online. They will have to submit certain credentials and will be verified once confirmed. Similar verification will be done when a student is assigned to a certain class.
</p>
<p>Information: 
Student information from registration will be forwarded to the teacher and admin.
</p>
<p>Live Class: 
Online Class interaction timing will depend on the internet connectivity and the speed. Probable chances of buffer/delay if internet speed is detected comparatively slower than usual.
</p>
<h3 id="Safety Requirements">5.2 Safety Requirements</h3>
<p>In case of a server breakdown, the last checkpoint will be saved automatically.</p>
<h3 id="Security Requirements">5.3 Security Requirements</h3>
<p>Every user of the website must log in in order to take part, and actions of the students will be monitored by the teacher. The files shared by the teacher must be limited to the viewer. Only students will be allowed to view the homeworks and assignments provided by the teacher. However, if the student posts his/her query in the QA platform, everyone will be able to view the post and take necessary measure. In that case, only teachers will be allowed to make any change to that post.</p>
<h3 id= "Software Quality Attributes">5.4 Software Quality Attributes</h3>
<p>We will use PHP in order to avoid our website from crashing. While as, WordPress and Laravel framework will help us make the project an industry-standard website.</p>
<h3 id="Business Rules">5.5	 Business Rules</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students cannot change his/her grades/standings/attendance.</li>
	<li>Student won’t be able to change the assignment/homework once submitted</li>
	<li>Students cannot share files in-between themselves</li>
	<li>Teacher-student confidentiality can be kept.</li>
</ul>
